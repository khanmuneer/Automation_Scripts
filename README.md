# Automation_Scripts
This repo contains all the scripts I've written (mainly in Python) to automate manual tasks. Some of these manual tasks were easy and some were a bit complicated. Nonetheless, all were tedious and time consuming. 

By automating these tasks I gave users a chance to focus on the real things. Things that matter and drive busineess value. 

Each script had it's own business case. I've added a note in each of the script,at the beginning, about it's use case. 

NOTE: This is an ongoing list. I will keep adding as I create.
